## Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/bironil/Wallpaper-kun/releases) page.
2. **Extract** the files to a folder of your choice.
3. **Move** the app to `C:\Program Files\Wallpaper-kun` for system-wide use (optional).
4. **Run** `Wallpaper-kun.exe`.

> **Note:** On first run, the app will create its data folders in  
> `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Wallpaper-kun\`
> - You may see a Windows warning that the app is unrecognized or "unsecure." This is because I did not pay $500+ for a Microsoft code signing certificate😆. The app is safe to use—just click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.
